    <h1>The Best Movie Series According to Nana Sakyi</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 series of all-time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Spartacus</h3>
    <p>
      This is my first favourite series as it talks about what went on during
      Rome Era and how the Arena was used as games that involved slaves who were
      trained as Gladiators.
    </p>
    <h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
    <p>
      This is my second top series and it depicts the fight for territory and
      the ultimate throne to rule the 7 kingdoms.
    </p>
    <h3>Power</h3>
    <p>
      This is a drug dealing Series which shows how some drug lords rise through
      ranks to attain the highest of their career and turn away from such
      life, look to have a nice family and provide social responsibilites
      amidst the law enforcment constant efforts to monitor and pin down drug
      lords and thugs.
